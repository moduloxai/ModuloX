# ModuloX Architecture

## Overview

ModuloX is a modular AI framework designed for building flexible and extensible AI agent systems. The architecture follows clean interface design principles and emphasizes modularity, reliability, and type safety.

## Core Components

### Agent System

The agent system is built around the `Agent` interface, which defines three fundamental capabilities:
- Task execution through the `Execute` method
- Tool integration via the `AddTool` method
- Capability discovery using `GetCapabilities`

The `BaseAgent` implementation provides:
- Integration with LLM providers
- Vector memory management
- Tool registry integration
- Type-safe execution

### LLM Provider

The LLM provider system abstracts language model interactions:
- Text completion generation
- Embedding vector creation
- Model configuration management
- Provider-specific parameter handling

### Memory System

The vector store system manages agent memory:
- Vector storage and retrieval
- Similarity search capabilities
- Memory context management
- Metadata handling

### Tool System

The tool integration system provides:
- Dynamic plugin loading
- Type-safe tool execution
- Capability discovery
- Tool registry management

## Communication System

The communication system enables agent collaboration through:
- Message bus for agent communication
- Event system for state changes
- Distributed state management
- Type-safe message passing

## Reliability Features

Built-in reliability mechanisms include:
- Circuit breaker for failure handling
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Error recovery strategies

## Multi-Agent Support

The framework supports multiple agent collaboration patterns:
- Sequential workflows
- Parallel execution with aggregation
- Dynamic agent orchestration
- Result combination strategies

## Configuration

The configuration system provides:
- JSON/YAML configuration support
- Environment variable integration
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Secure credential management

## Extension Points

The framework can be extended through:
- Custom LLM providers
- New tool implementations
- Alternative memory backends
- Additional workflow patterns

## Best Practices

When building with ModuloX:
1. Use interfaces for flexibility
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Consider rate limits and quotas
4. Test reliability features
5. Document new components
